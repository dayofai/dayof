## üö® CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required

### 1. FormanceLedger Refund Handling

**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKER**  
**Context**: Need to understand how FormanceLedger tracks refunds  
**Jon's Quote**: "Honestly, I don't know off the top of my head. This is something that we need to look into."  
**Timeline**: Before FormanceLedger integration (2 weeks)  
**Action**: Research FormanceLedger refund tracking patterns and implement

**Questions to Answer**:

- How does FormanceLedger represent refunds in double-entry ledger?
- Does refund reverse original transaction or create new offsetting entries?
- How to handle partial refunds?
- How to track who absorbs refund fees (venue vs platform)?

---

### 2. Ticket Instance Schema

**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**  
**Context**: Ticket Type = Product (live in 1 week), but Ticket Instance schema undefined  
**Jon's Quote**: "Not sure. Don't have a specific timeline. It'll get done when it gets done."  
**Timeline**: TBD  
**Action**: Create Linear issue to define Ticket Instance schema

**Critical Concerns**:

- How instances link back to product/product variant
- Where NanoID is stored (on instance)
- **IMMUTABILITY/VERSIONING** - snapshot product at time of sale
- Prevent drift when products change after sale
- More elegant solution than simple snapshots

**Schema Requirements**:

- Reference to product/product variant (at time of sale)
- NanoID (unique ticket identifier)
- Snapshot of product configuration at purchase time
- Creation timestamp
- Customer/purchaser reference
- Status (active, used, refunded, etc.)
- Scan history

---

### 3. Product/Variant Immutability & Versioning

**Status**: ‚ùå **ARCHITECTURE DECISION NEEDED**  
**Context**: Must preserve exact product state at time of sale  
**Jon's Quote**: "Fundamentally though, we need to dig a little bit further into this and arrive at a slightly more elegant solution."  
**Timeline**: Before Ticket Instance schema (blocking)  
**Action**: Design versioning strategy for products/variants

**Current Plan** (needs improvement):

- Take complete snapshot of product/product variant at time of order
- Store snapshot so ticket instance can reference exact configuration

**Better Solutions to Explore**:

- Product version numbers with historical versions table
- Immutable product variant records (never update, create new version)
- Event sourcing for product changes (rejected for app, but maybe for products?)
- Copy-on-write strategy
- Time-travel queries on product history

**Requirements**:

- Ticket instance must always reference exact product as sold
- Cannot have "drift" if product is edited after sale
- Need to support refunds referencing original product state
- Must be queryable: "What did this product look like when sold?"

---

### 4. Workspace ID Scoping

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DECISION REQUIRED**  
**Context**: Multi-tenancy needs both Tenant/Org ID AND Workspace ID  
**Jon's Quote**: "Please make a note about the workspace ID. I think that one's important. Either that needs to be handled by the rules engine or it needs to be on the tables."  
**Timeline**: Before schema finalization (1 week)  
**Action**: Decide scoping strategy

**Options**:

1. **Workspace ID on tables** (like Tenant/Org ID)

   - Pros: Database-level isolation, simple queries
   - Cons: More columns, migration complexity

2. **Workspace ID in rules engine** (Effect-TS)

   - Pros: Flexible, doesn't clutter schema
   - Cons: Must ensure consistent enforcement

3. **Hybrid**: Critical tables get Workspace ID, others use rules engine

**Questions**:

- What is a Workspace? (vs Organization vs Tenant)
- Which tables need Workspace ID?
- How does Workspace relate to user roles?
- Do workspaces nest or relate hierarchically?

**Recommendation Needed**: Jon to decide which approach

---

### 5. FormanceLedger Chart of Accounts

**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**  
**Context**: Need to map all actors and accounts before ledger integration  
**Jon's Quote**: "We probably need to create a sample chart of accounts... first step: Map all actors and all accounts that might exist."  
**Timeline**: Before FormanceLedger integration (2 weeks)  
**Action**: Create comprehensive chart of accounts

**Known Accounts**:

**Customers**:

- Individual customer accounts (one per purchaser)

**Venues/Tenants**:

### 6. Stripe Webhook Signature Verification

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY**  
**Context**: Webhooks received directly in Inngest - need to confirm security  
**Jon's Quote**: "Good point. Make a note. Probably need to look into it. Pretty sure it's handled by Inngest, though."  
**Timeline**: Before payment processing goes live (2 weeks)  
**Action**: Verify Inngest handles Stripe signature verification

**Questions**:

- Does Inngest automatically verify Stripe webhook signatures?
- If not, where do we add verification logic?
- How do we configure Stripe webhook secret in Inngest?
- What happens if signature verification fails?

**Test Plan**:

1. Send test webhook from Stripe to Inngest endpoint
2. Verify signature checking is working
3. Test failure case (invalid signature)
4. Document configuration steps
