# Compiled State Chat Light

## First, identify what I need

- The type of technical problem being solved
- The evolution pattern (linear, branching, pivoting)
- The key decisions and their current status
- The appropriate level of technical detail

## Then execute as

- Role: Software Documentation Specialist
- Mission: Extract authoritative current state from evolving discussion
- Approach: Chronological analysis with recency weighting
- Output: Structured state document with decision log and branches

Key principle: Recent messages override older ones, but preserve the "why" behind changes. When unclear, branch rather than guess.
