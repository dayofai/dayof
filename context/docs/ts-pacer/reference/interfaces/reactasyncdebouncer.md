### state

```ts
readonly state: Readonly<TSelected>;
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts:20](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts#L20)

Reactive state that will be updated and re-rendered when the debouncer state changes

Use this instead of `debouncer.store.state`

***

### ~~store~~

```ts
readonly store: Store<Readonly<AsyncDebouncerState<TFn>>>;
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts:26](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts#L26)

#### Deprecated

Use `debouncer.state` instead of `debouncer.store.state` if you want to read reactive state.
The state on the store object is not reactive, as it has not been wrapped in a `useStore` hook internally.
Although, you can make the state reactive by using the `useStore` in your own usage.
