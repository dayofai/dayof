# Function: useRateLimitedCallback()

```ts
function useRateLimitedCallback<TFn>(fn, options): (...args) => boolean
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/rate-limiter/useRateLimitedCallback.ts:59](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/rate-limiter/useRateLimitedCallback.ts#L59)

A React hook that creates a rate-limited version of a callback function.
This hook is essentially a wrapper around the basic `rateLimiter` function
that is exported from `@tanstack/pacer`,
but optimized for React with reactive options and a stable function reference.

Rate limiting is a simple "hard limit" approach - it allows all calls until the limit
is reached, then blocks subsequent calls until the window resets. Unlike throttling
or debouncing, it does not attempt to space out or intelligently collapse calls.
This can lead to bursts of rapid executions followed by periods where all calls
are blocked.

The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
- 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
  towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
- 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
  consistent rate of execution over time.

For smoother execution patterns, consider:
- useThrottledCallback: When you want consistent spacing between executions (e.g. UI updates)
- useDebouncedCallback: When you want to collapse rapid calls into a single execution (e.g. search input)

Rate limiting should primarily be used when you need to enforce strict limits,
like API rate limits or other scenarios requiring hard caps on execution frequency.

This hook provides a simpler API compared to `useRateLimiter`, making it ideal for basic
rate limiting needs. However, it does not expose the underlying RateLimiter instance.

For advanced usage requiring features like:
- Manual cancellation
- Access to execution counts
- Custom useCallback dependencies

Consider using the `useRateLimiter` hook instead.
