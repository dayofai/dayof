# Function: useAsyncThrottledCallback()

```ts
function useAsyncThrottledCallback<TFn>(fn, options): (...args) => Promise<ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottledCallback.ts:42](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottledCallback.ts#L42)

A React hook that creates a throttled version of an async callback function.
This hook is a convenient wrapper around the `useAsyncThrottler` hook,
providing a stable, throttled async function reference for use in React components.

The throttled async function will execute at most once within the specified wait time period,
regardless of how many times it is called. If called multiple times during the wait period,
only the first invocation will execute, and subsequent calls will be ignored until
the wait period has elapsed. The returned function always returns a promise
that resolves or rejects with the result of the original async function.

This hook provides a simpler API compared to `useAsyncThrottler`, making it ideal for basic
async throttling needs. However, it does not expose the underlying AsyncThrottler instance.

For advanced usage requiring features like:
- Manual cancellation
- Access to execution/error state
- Custom useCallback dependencies

Consider using the `useAsyncThrottler` hook instead.

```tsx
// Throttle an async API call
const handleApiCall = useAsyncThrottledCallback(async (data) => {
  const result = await sendDataToServer(data);
  return result;
}, {
  wait: 200 // Execute at most once every 200ms
});

// Use in an event handler
<button onClick={() => handleApiCall(formData)}>Send</button>
```
