# Function: useAsyncBatcher()

```ts
function useAsyncBatcher<TValue, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
selector): ReactAsyncBatcher<TValue, TSelected>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-batcher/useAsyncBatcher.ts:167](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-batcher/useAsyncBatcher.ts#L167)

A React hook that creates an `AsyncBatcher` instance for managing asynchronous batches of items.

This is the async version of the useBatcher hook. Unlike the sync version, this async batcher:
- Handles promises and returns results from batch executions
- Provides error handling with configurable error behavior
- Tracks success, error, and settle counts separately
- Has state tracking for when batches are executing
- Returns the result of the batch function execution

Features:
- Configurable batch size and wait time
- Custom batch processing logic via getShouldExecute
- Event callbacks for monitoring batch operations
- Error handling for failed batch operations
- Automatic or manual batch processing

The batcher collects items and processes them in batches based on:
- Maximum batch size (number of items per batch)
- Time-based batching (process after X milliseconds)
- Custom batch processing logic via getShouldExecute

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and batcher instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncBatcher instance

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
component re-render when the selected state values change.

Available state properties:
- `errorCount`: Number of batch executions that have resulted in errors
- `failedItems`: Array of items that failed during batch processing
- `isEmpty`: Whether the batcher has no items to process
- `isExecuting`: Whether a batch is currently being processed asynchronously
- `isPending`: Whether the batcher is waiting for the timeout to trigger batch processing
- `isRunning`: Whether the batcher is active and will process items automatically
- `items`: Array of items currently queued for batch processing
- `lastResult`: The result from the most recent batch execution
- `settleCount`: Number of batch executions that have completed (success or error)
- `size`: Number of items currently in the batch queue
- `status`: Current processing status ('idle' | 'pending' | 'executing' | 'populated')
- `successCount`: Number of batch executions that have completed successfully
- `totalItemsProcessed`: Total number of items processed across all batches
- `totalItemsFailed`: Total number of items that have failed processing

## Type Parameters

## Parameters

### fn

(`items`) => `Promise`\<`any`\>

### options

`AsyncBatcherOptions`\<`TValue`\> = `{}`

## Returns

[`ReactAsyncBatcher`](../../interfaces/reactasyncbatcher.md)\<`TValue`, `TSelected`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic async batcher for API requests - no reactive state subscriptions
const asyncBatcher = useAsyncBatcher(
  async (items) => {
    const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
    return results;
  },
  { maxSize: 10, wait: 2000 }
);

// Opt-in to re-render when execution state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
const asyncBatcher = useAsyncBatcher(
  async (items) => {
    const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
    return results;
  },
  { maxSize: 10, wait: 2000 },
  (state) => ({
    isExecuting: state.isExecuting,
    isPending: state.isPending,
    status: state.status
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when results are available (optimized for data display)
const asyncBatcher = useAsyncBatcher(
  async (items) => {
    const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
    return results;
  },
  { maxSize: 10, wait: 2000 },
  (state) => ({
    lastResult: state.lastResult,
    successCount: state.successCount,
    totalItemsProcessed: state.totalItemsProcessed
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when error state changes (optimized for error handling)
const asyncBatcher = useAsyncBatcher(
  async (items) => {
    const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
    return results;
  },
  {
    maxSize: 10,
    wait: 2000,
    onError: (error) => console.error('Batch processing failed:', error)
  },
  (state) => ({
    errorCount: state.errorCount,
    failedItems: state.failedItems,
    totalItemsFailed: state.totalItemsFailed
  })
);

// Complete example with all callbacks
const asyncBatcher = useAsyncBatcher(
  async (items) => {
    const results = await Promise.all(items.map(item => processItem(item)));
    return results;
  },
  {
    maxSize: 10,
    wait: 2000,
    onSuccess: (result) => {
      console.log('Batch processed successfully:', result);
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('Batch processing failed:', error);
    }
  }
);

// Add items to batch
asyncBatcher.addItem(newItem);

// Manually execute batch
const result = await asyncBatcher.execute();

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { isExecuting, lastResult, size } = asyncBatcher.state;
```
