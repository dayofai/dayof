# Function: useAsyncDebouncedCallback()

```ts
function useAsyncDebouncedCallback<TFn>(fn, options): (...args) => Promise<ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncedCallback.ts:44](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncedCallback.ts#L44)

A React hook that creates a debounced version of an async callback function.
This hook is a convenient wrapper around the `useAsyncDebouncer` hook,
providing a stable, debounced async function reference for use in React components.

The debounced async function will only execute after the specified wait time has elapsed
since its last invocation. If called again before the wait time expires, the timer
resets and starts waiting again. The returned function always returns a promise
that resolves or rejects with the result of the original async function.

This hook provides a simpler API compared to `useAsyncDebouncer`, making it ideal for basic
async debouncing needs. However, it does not expose the underlying AsyncDebouncer instance.

For advanced usage requiring features like:
- Manual cancellation
- Access to execution/error state
- Custom useCallback dependencies

Consider using the `useAsyncDebouncer` hook instead.

## Example

```tsx
// Debounce an async search handler
const handleSearch = useAsyncDebouncedCallback(async (query: string) => {
  const results = await fetchSearchResults(query);
  return results;
}, {
  wait: 500 // Wait 500ms between executions
});

// Use in an input
<input
  type="search"
  onChange={e => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
/>
```
