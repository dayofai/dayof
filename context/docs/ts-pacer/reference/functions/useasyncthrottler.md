# Function: useAsyncThrottler()

```ts
function useAsyncThrottler<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
selector): ReactAsyncThrottler<TFn, TSelected>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottler.ts:160](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottler.ts#L160)

A low-level React hook that creates an `AsyncThrottler` instance to limit how often an async function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).

Async throttling ensures an async function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting expensive API calls,
database operations, or other async tasks.

Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and throttler instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
component re-render when the selected state values change.

Available state properties:
- `errorCount`: Number of function executions that have resulted in errors
- `isExecuting`: Whether the throttled function is currently executing asynchronously
- `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
- `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
- `lastExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the last function execution in milliseconds
- `lastResult`: The result from the most recent successful function execution
- `nextExecutionTime`: Timestamp when the next execution can occur in milliseconds
- `settleCount`: Number of function executions that have completed (success or error)
- `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending' | 'executing' | 'settled')
- `successCount`: Number of function executions that have completed successfully

## Example

```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data; // Return value is preserved
  },
  { wait: 1000 }
);

// Opt-in to re-render when execution state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({
    isExecuting: state.isExecuting,
    isPending: state.isPending,
    status: state.status
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when results are available (optimized for data display)
const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({
    lastResult: state.lastResult,
    successCount: state.successCount,
    settleCount: state.settleCount
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when error state changes (optimized for error handling)
const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  {
    wait: 1000,
    onError: (error) => console.error('API call failed:', error)
  },
  (state) => ({
    errorCount: state.errorCount,
    status: state.status
  })
);

// Opt-in to re-render when timing information changes (optimized for timing displays)
const asyncThrottler = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({
    lastExecutionTime: state.lastExecutionTime,
    nextExecutionTime: state.nextExecutionTime
  })
);

// With state management and return value
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const { maybeExecute, state } = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (query) => {
    const result = await searchAPI(query);
    setData(result);
    return result; // Return value can be used by the caller
  },
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
  }
);

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { isExecuting, lastResult } = state;
```
